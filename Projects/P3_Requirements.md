# Project 3 (Tentative Due: 8/30/24)

## Overview

For P3, you and your team will create a full stack web application utilizing all the technologies we've learned in the training

## Requirements

- Application Must build and run
- Back end Unit Testing (70% code coverage for Services layer)
- Front-end Unit Testing (20% code coverage)
- User Authentication
- Both ends hosted on Azure Cloud Services
- CI/CD Pipeline
- Docker Containerized backend (Stretch goal!)

## Proposal

You'll create a project proposal as a team that includes overview of the project, mvp features, and stretch goals.
Please come up with a new project idea that is not a continuation of a P2 project!

Include the following in your proposal:

- Project Overview
- MVP features
- ERD
- Stretch Goals

These are not included in the proposal, but do discuss the following:

- Git Practice/Process (merge/code review practice/branch protection)
- Coding Convention/Practice
- Communication standard
  - Which medium are we going to use to communicate?
  - At what frequency?
- How are we managing the project board? (Jira, Github, etc)

## Technology

- C# (Backend programming language)
- EF Core (ORM)
- SQL Server (Azure hosted)
- ASP.NET Core (Web API Framework)
- xUnit/Moq (Backend Testing)
- Azure (for application hosting)
- Jest for front end testing
- React as front end
