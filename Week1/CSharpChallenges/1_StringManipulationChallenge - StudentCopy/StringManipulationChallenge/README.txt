Challenge 1 – String and its methods

Now you know the use of various string functions. 
Let’s create a small Console application to practice this.

 -- Part 1 --
1. Declare a string variable and an integer variable but don't assign values to them.
2. Get a string from the user. We are not worried about input validation right now
    so if your user inputs unexpected values, your program will give unexpected results.
3. Print to the console “Please enter your message and press enter”.
4. The user will enter their message.
5. Assign that entered string to the string variable which you declared initially.
6. Print to the console "Please enter a number LESS THAN the length of your string and press enter".
7. Assign that entered string to the int variable which you declared initially. 
8. You will need to parse the string to an int using 'int.parse();'
9. Call each of the provided methods with the correct arguments.
10. Print the return of each method to the console.
11. Declare a char variable but do not assign a value to it.
12. Ask the user "For which character should I search in your original message?"
13. Same the user input to the char variable. **remember we are not validating 
    user input at this time so is the letter (char value) isn't in the message, 
    you won't be able to find it.
14. Call the SearchChar method and print the result to the console.
15. Ask the user for their first name and save it to a string variable.
16. Ask the user for their last name and save it to a variable.
17. Call the ConcatNames method and print the full name result to the console.
