Challenge - Datatypes And Variables

Now that you know how to declare and initialize Variables,
1. create a variable for each of the "primitive" datatypes (you can find 
the list below).
2. Leave the Object datatype out.
3. Initialize each variable with a valid value.
4. Create two values of type string. 
   - The first one should say "I control text"
   - The second one should be a whole number. 
5. Create a method that uses the .TryParse() method in order to convert that string to an integer.
6. Add an output for each of the variables and write it onto the console. (WriteLine)
