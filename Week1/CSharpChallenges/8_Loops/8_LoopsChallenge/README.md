# Loopdy Loops Challenge
1. Create a for loop in the ```UseFor()``` method that displays the odd integers from 0 to 50 on the same line.
2. Create a do/while loop in the ```UseDoWhile``` method that displays the even integers from 0 to 50 on the same line.
3. Create a while loop in the ```UseWhile()``` method that displays the multiples of 3 integers from 0 to 100 on new lines for each number. 
    -  Design the loop so that when every multiple of 3 and 5 coincide(like 15, 30, etc), you print "skipping this number" instead of the number.
    -  Design the loop so that when you get above 100 you automatically stop the loop with a break statement.
