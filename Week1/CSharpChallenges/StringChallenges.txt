Challenge 1 – String and its methods

- Declare a string variable and an integer variable but don't assign values to them.
- Print to the console “Please enter your message and press enter”.
- Get a string from the user. We are not worried about input validation right now
    so if your user inputs unexpected values, your program will give unexpected results.

- The user will enter their message.
- Assign that entered string to the string variable which you declared initially.
- Print to the console "Please enter a number LESS THAN the length of your string and press enter".
- Assign that entered string to the int variable which you declared initially. 
- Remember to parse the input to an int.
- Declare a char variable but do not assign a value to it.
- Ask the user "For which character should I search in your original message?"
- Same the user input to the char variable. **remember we are not validating 
    user input at this time so is the letter (char value) isn't in the message, 
    you won't be able to find it.
- Ask the user for their first name and save it to a string variable.
- Ask the user for their last name and save it to a variable.
- Print to the console a concatination of the users first and last name.
- Print to the console the users initials
- Print to the console the users first name and the first two letters of their last name.
- Print the length of the users last name to the console.
