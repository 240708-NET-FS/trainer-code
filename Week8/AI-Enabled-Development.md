# What is AI Enabled Development?
- It is a way for developers to produce code by simply describing the functionalities required to a generative AI (LLM) instead of manually typing out code.

## What is LLM?
- LLM, Large Language Models are AI models trained on a vast amount of diverse text data. They use deep neural networks to genreate patterns, relationships, and context, which allows them to answer prompts in a human-like fashion.
- Examples of LLM's: ChatGPT, Llama (Meta), Gemini "formerly known as Bard" (Google)
- *As of now AI's that use LLM's will "generate" answers to prompts, that means they are simply using pattern matching to answer you. So while it seems that AI's have context, that context is very limited and this is why AI's often "hallucinate" or give false information.

## What are some AI tools developers can use?
- Codeium, Copilot, ChatGPT
### What are some ways devs can use AI?
- Generate boilerplate code
- Generate unit tests
- Debug

## Topics to think about concerning the use of AI in software development
- Security
    - eg. Personal/Organizational info leaks
- Ethics
    - eg. Bias and accountability
## What is prompt engineering?
- Please do a few minutes of research into this. QC might ask you "How can you improve this prompt?"
    - eg. Improve this prompt: `Show me some fake data for people objects I can use for testing`
        - Provide more context: `Print a list of 5 people objects in C# with the following fields: firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, email`
        - Provide examples: `Print the data in this format: Person1[firstName=John, lastName=Smith, dateOfBirth=1/1/2000, email=jsmith@gmail.com]`
    - Improve this prompt? `Translate this text: Hola y cómo te va`
        - Provide more context: `Translate this text from Spanish to French: Hola y cómo te va`
